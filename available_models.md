# Available Models

Topaz Labs offers two different general classes of AI models:

## Model Classes

- **Standard**: These models are incredibly fast and efficient, and preserve the original fidelity and details of source images with maximum accuracy. Recommended for most professional use cases.
- **Generative**: These models can produce the highest quality and most creative outputs, at the cost of speed and fidelity to the original image. Recommended for most creative use cases.

> **Note**: Generative models are only available as asynchronous endpoints since these powerful models can take up to several minutes to complete; blocking a HTTP request for extended periods of time is not recommended.

---

## Enhance

These are our industry-standard upscaling and image enhancement models, which run blazingly fast and work great for most scenarios.

> Each of the models listed below are of the **Standard** class. None of these models are generative or diffusion-based.

### Standard Enhance Models

| Model | Description | Parameters |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **Standard V2** | General-purpose model balancing detail, sharpness, and noise reduction for various images. | `sharpen`, `denoise`, `fix_compression` |
| **Low Resolution V2** | Enhances clarity and detail in low-resolution images like web graphics and screenshots. | `sharpen`, `denoise`, `fix_compression` |
| **CGI** | Optimized for CGI and digital illustrations, enhancing texture and detail in computer-generated images. | `sharpen`, `denoise` |
| **High Fidelity V2** | Ideal for high-quality images, preserving intricate details in professional photography. | `sharpen`, `denoise`, `fix_compression` |
| **Text Refine** | Designed for images with text and shapes, enhancing clarity and sharpness of elements. | `strength`, `sharpen`, `denoise`, `fix_compression` |

### Standard Enhance Parameters

- **`sharpen`**: Slightly sharpens the image. *(decimal from 0 to 1)*
- **`denoise`**: Reduces noise in the image. *(decimal from 0 to 1)*
- **`fix_compression`**: Reduces compression artifacts to improve details. *(decimal from 0 to 1)*
- **`strength`**: Controls model strength. Too high of a result can make results look unrealistic *(decimal from 0.01 to 1)*

> **Implementation Note**: These parameters should be appended as key-value fields in the form-data request bodies (i.e. alongside the `model`, `output_height`, and `face_enhancement` etc. fields). Any parameters not explicitly provided are automatically configured by our auto-parameter model. Extra parameters provided that are not supported are ignored.

## Enhance Generative

Our latest cutting-edge and most powerful generative AI models which can repair, reconstruct, and enhance your images. **These models only run asynchronously.**

> **Note**: These Generative models may produce creative outputs under certain scenarios. If you're looking for more consistent generations, you may consider our class of Standard models.

### Generative Enhance Models

| Model | Description | Parameters |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **Redefine** | Elevate creativity with realistic upscaling, prioritizing either fidelity or creative detail. Ideal for low-resolution, blurry, and AI-generated images. | `prompt`, `autoprompt`, `creativity`, `texture`, `sharpen`, `denoise` |
| **Recovery** | Delivers high fidelity upscaling for extremely low-resolution images, preserving natural detail and sharpness. | `detail` |
| **Recovery V2** | Newest model that delivers high fidelity upscaling for extremely low-resolution images, preserving natural detail and sharpness. | `detail` |

### Generative Enhance Parameters

- **`prompt`**: A description of the resulting image you are looking for. The model responds more to a descriptive statement versus a directive one. 
  - Example: Use *"girl with red hair and blue eyes"* instead of *"change the girl's hair to red and make her eyes blue"*
  - *(text - max 1024 characters)*
- **`autoprompt`**: Whether you want to use our state-of-the-art autoprompting model to auto-generate a prompt for you. If enabled, ignores value given to prompt. *(boolean)*
- **`creativity`**: Lower creativity values maintain the highest fidelity to the original image. Higher values take more liberties and provide more creative results for specific details. *(integer from 1 to 6)*
- **`texture`**: Add texture to the image. Recommend setting texture to 1 for at a low creativity level, and 3 for more creative results at a higher creativity level. *(integer from 1 to 5)*
- **`sharpen`**: Slightly sharpens the image. *(decimal from 0 to 1)*
- **`denoise`**: Reduces noise in the image. *(decimal from 0 to 1)*
- **`detail`**: Adjusts the level of added detail after rendering. *(decimal from 0 to 1)*

## Sharpen

You can use the Sharpen models to create crisp, sharp image outputs, removing blur and bringing the subject or entire image into focus.

> All of the Sharpen models listed below are **Standard** type models, and are not generative.

### Standard Sharpen Models

| Model | Description | Parameters |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **Standard** | All-purpose sharpening, intended for images with slight amounts of lens and motion blur. | `strength`, `minor_denoise` |
| **Strong** | For very blurry and out-of-focus images. Try the Standard model before the Strong model to avoid over sharpening and generating unwanted artifacts. | `strength` |
| **Lens Blur** | Ideal for images affected by imperfections caused when the camera lens fails to focus correctly. | `strength`, `minor_denoise` |
| **Lens Blur V2** | Generation 2 of the Lens Blur model, producing more consistent and stronger sharpening results in most scenarios. | `strength`, `minor_denoise` |
| **Motion Blur** | Optimized to correct the streaked or smeared effect caused by the movement of either the camera or the subject during the exposure time. | `strength`, `minor_denoise` |
| **Natural** | Designed to sharpen objects and keep textures looking natural. | `strength`, `minor_denoise` |
| **Refocus** | Emphasize details and bring out finer lines or texture. | `strength`, `minor_denoise` |

### Standard Sharpen Parameters

- **`strength`**: Increases details. Too much sharpening can create an unrealistic result. *(decimal from 0.01 to 1)*
- **`minor_denoise`**: Removes noisy pixels to increase clarity. Can slightly increase image sharpness. *(decimal from 0.01 to 1)*

## Sharpen Generative

A more powerful version of Sharpening using generative AI to add back missing information when refocusing and sharpening an image.

> **Note**: Under some scenarios, these models may be Generative as compared to our Standard sharpening models.

### Generative Sharpen Models

| Model | Description | Parameters |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **Super Focus** | Fix blur and extract detail on the most stubborn and difficult images that cannot be enhanced through other sharpening models. | `strength`, `focus_boost`, `seed` |
| **Super Focus V2** | Our newest model that fixes blur and extract detail on the most stubborn and difficult images that cannot be enhanced through other sharpening models. | `detail`, `focus_boost` |

### Generative Sharpen Parameters

- **`strength`**: Increases details. Too much sharpening can create an unrealistic result. *(decimal from 0 to 1)*
- **`detail`**: Increases details. Too much sharpening can create an unrealistic result. *(decimal from 0 to 1)*
  - > **Note**: 'Strength' was renamed to 'Detail' in Super Focus V2
- **`focus_boost`**: Use on very blurry images! Focus boost corrects images that are missing detail by downscaling your image then upscaling the results back to the original size. *(decimal from 0.25 to 1)*
- **`seed`**: Generation seed. *(integer from -2147483648 to 2147483647)*

## Denoise

Remove sensor noise and grain from images, creating crisp and smooth details. Does wonders especially for low-light or RAW images. Under some scenarios, these models can even be used to remove dust and splotches on an image.

> All of these models are **Standard** class models, and are not Generative.

### Denoise Models

| Model | Description | Parameters |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **Normal** | Ideal to remove low-medium noise caused by low-light conditions or compression artifacts, usually for images from smartphones and cameras with their own denoise models to avoid over-processing. | `strength`, `minor_deblur`, `original_detail` |
| **Strong** | Designed to strongly emphasize retaining image detail for medium-high noise images. Use it for images from very low-light conditions. | `strength`, `minor_deblur`, `original_detail` |
| **Extreme** | Prioritizes removing as much noise as possible rather than preserving detail. Use it for images with severe noise or heavy compression, such as those shared over the internet. | `strength`, `minor_deblur`, `original_detail` |

### Denoise Parameters

- **`strength`**: Reduces noise in the image. Too high can remove detail and slightly blur the image. *(decimal from 0.01 to 1)*
- **`minor_deblur`**: Slightly sharpens the image. Counteracts softness caused by noise reduction. *(decimal from 0.01 to 1)*
- **`original_detail`**: Return texture and fine details lost during noise reduction. Start at low values and slowly increase. *(decimal from 0 to 1)*
